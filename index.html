            <h2>The Great Gatsby</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
            <p><strong>Review:</strong> "The Great Gatsby" is a classic novel that explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, the story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who observes the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald's prose is elegant and evocative, capturing the spirit of the 1920s while also critiquing the American Dream. The characters are complex and flawed, making for a compelling read that resonates even today.</p>
